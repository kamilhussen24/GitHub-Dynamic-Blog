# 📰 GitHub Dynamic Blog using GitHub Pages

This project is a **dynamic blogging system** powered entirely by **GitHub Pages**. It allows you to write blog articles using plain `.html` files inside a `/post` directory, and the homepage (`index.html`) will automatically display them as individual blog posts — similar to Blogger, but without any CMS.

Ideal for developers, writers, and tech-savvy users who want a lightweight, fast, and free blogging platform.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Dynamic Blog Posts**: All `.html` files inside the `/post` folder are treated as blog posts.
- ✅ **Automatic Post Listing**: The homepage (`index.html`) dynamically lists all available blog posts.
- ✅ **No CMS Needed**: Write your articles directly in HTML — clean, fast, and flexible.
- ✅ **Static + Fast**: No backend or database needed. Entirely runs on GitHub Pages.
- ✅ **Free Hosting**: Uses GitHub’s free Pages hosting.
- ✅ **Open to Contributions**: Designed to be forkable and customizable.
